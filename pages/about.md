## About the Author

### Leobardo Óscar Alcántara Ocaña
##### Photographer, Librarian and Web designer.

<p> Enthusiast of weather phenomena and cloud observation and appreciation. </p> 

**[Note]**

- Since I'm not a meteorologist, cloud classification may not be accurate.

- For comprehensive scientific and technical information about clouds -and other meteors, visit the <a href="https://cloudatlas.wmo.int/en/foreword-to-the-2017-edition.html" title=""> 
"International Cloud Atlas" </a> from the <a href="" title="https://wmo.int/"> World Meteorological Organization </a>. 

If you have any classification corrections or comments, feel free to email me at leobardooscar@gmail.com 

<i> Happy hunting & watching! </i> :-)
